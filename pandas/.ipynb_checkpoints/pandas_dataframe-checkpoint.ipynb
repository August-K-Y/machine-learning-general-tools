    "Pandas DataFrames are `two-dimensional data structures` with `labeled rows and columns`, that can hold many data types. If you are familiar with Excel, you can think of Pandas DataFrames as being similar to a spreadsheet. We can create Pandas DataFrames manually or by loading data from a file. In this notebook we will create Pandas DataFrames manually from dictionaries and later we will see how we can load data into a DataFrame from a data file.\n",

    "We will start by creating a DataFrame manually from a dictionary of Pandas Series. In this case the first step is to create the dictionary of Pandas Series. After the dictionary is created we can then pass the dictionary to the `pd.DataFrame()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a dictionary that contains items purchased by two people, Alice and Bob, on an online store. The `Pandas Series` will use the price of the items purchased as data, and the purchased items (i.e., item names) will be used as the index labels to the Pandas Series. \n",
